# Transform outbound credentials

Use `SecurityProfile.spec.rules[].actions.tokenTransformation` to replace a sandbox-supplied credential with an API key or sign an outbound request with Aliyun STS credentials. Egress Policy Enforcer (EPE) obtains the credential after a rule matches, so a long-lived provider credential does not need to enter the sandbox.

This task configures the built-in `ApiKey` signer with a credential provider. The provider HTTP contract is [Credential provider](../reference/credential-provider.md); policy fields are defined by the [SecurityProfile reference](../reference/security-profile.md).

## Before you begin

Enable EPE and configure `epe.identityProviderUrl` with the provider's single HTTPS endpoint. This task assumes Agentio is already installed for the selected workload, so update that release with `--reuse-values`; without it, Helm can replace the release's routing, gateway, data-plane, and image settings with chart defaults. From the repository root:

```console
$ tee epe-provider-values.yaml >/dev/null <<'EOF'
epe:
  enabled: true
  identityProviderUrl: https://credentials.example.net/v1/resource-credential
  env:
    STS_CACHE_MAX_SIZE: "100000"
EOF

$ helm upgrade agentio ./manifests/charts/agentio \
    --namespace agentio-system \
    --reuse-values \
    --values epe-provider-values.yaml
```

For a new installation, provide the complete installation values instead of this EPE-only fragment; [Get started with EPE](../getting-started/epe.md#enable-epe) shows the update path after an Agentio release exists.

Replace the example URL with a provider endpoint reachable from the EPE Pods. The chart maps it to `IDENTITY_PROVIDER_URL`, sets the API-key cache to `TOKEN_CACHE_TTL=3h` and `TOKEN_CACHE_MAX_SIZE=10000`, and the example makes the default STS cache capacity explicit. See [EPE configuration](../reference/epe-configuration.md#credential-provider-and-webhook-environment-variables) for the complete Helm and environment surface.

The provider must authenticate the EPE client and authorize the sandbox identity carried in Envoy `filter_state['sandbox.token']`. A missing or malformed sandbox token cannot serve a provider-backed rule.

This example matches `https://api.example.com`, so the selected egress gateway must terminate TLS for `api.example.com`; otherwise the connection stays on the gateway's TCP path and never reaches EPE's HTTP filter chain. Configure `egressGateways[].tlsTermination.includeHosts`, ensure the chart renders `ENABLE_ON_DEMAND_CERTS=true`, and make the calling workload trust the signing CA as described in [TLS termination for HTTPS inspection](../reference/agentio-configuration.md#tls-termination-for-https-inspection).

## Apply a provider-backed API-key transformation

The complete policy below matches calls from selected Pods to `api.example.com`, obtains a short-lived API key from provider configuration `example-api`, and replaces the `Authorization` header with `Bearer <key>`. Its provider metadata is rendered per request; it is not a Kubernetes Secret reference.

```yaml
apiVersion: agents.kruise.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecurityProfile
metadata:
  name: example-api-credentials
  namespace: agent-demo
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: agent
  inputs:
  - name: routing
    inline:
      tenant: production
  rules:
  - name: transform-example-api
    match:
    - domains:
      - api.example.com
      schemes:
      - https
      paths:
      - type: Prefix
        value: /v1/
    actions:
      tokenTransformation:
        type: ApiKey
        failStrategy: Block
        credentialRef:
          credentialProvider:
            name: example-api
            parameters:
              audience:
                value: example-api
              namespace:
                template: '{{ .Pod.Namespace }}'
              tenant:
                cel: inputs.routing.tenant
        apiKey:
          targetHeader: Authorization
          valueTemplate: 'Bearer {{ .Token }}'
```

Apply it with `kubectl apply -f example-api-credentials.yaml`. The source identity's bearer token and sandbox client ID travel only from EPE to the configured provider; neither is available to CEL nor to policy templates.

## Verify the transformation

First confirm that Kubernetes accepted the exact typed provider reference:

```console
$ kubectl get securityprofile example-api-credentials \
    --namespace agent-demo --output yaml
```

Then send a request from a selected sandbox through the egress gateway. Verify on the trusted upstream or a controlled test endpoint that it receives the generated `Authorization` value, not the sandbox's original value. Do not echo credentials in shared logs.

Repeat the request with the same provider name, sandbox client ID, and rendered metadata. An API-key cache hit avoids another provider request until `TOKEN_CACHE_TTL` expires or the bounded LRU evicts the entry. Changing a metadata value changes the cache key.

## Credential sources, signers, and failure behavior

`credentialRef` is a union: set exactly one of `secret` or `credentialProvider`.

- `secret` reads a Kubernetes Secret once per request. `ApiKey` expects data key `apiKey`; `AliyunSTS` expects `accessKeyId`, `accessKeySecret`, and `securityToken`. A missing Secret, missing data key, invalid header value, provider failure, or signer failure follows `failStrategy`.
- For `secret.namespace`, EPE uses the reference namespace, then the `SecurityProfile` namespace, then the selected Pod namespace. A `GlobalSecurityProfile` therefore falls back to the selected Pod namespace. A permission-denied Secret read is logged at most once per credential reference per minute, then follows `failStrategy`.
- `credentialProvider` requires a valid sandbox token and passes its evaluated `parameters` as `extraMetadata`. Every parameter must set exactly one of `value`, `template`, or `cel`; CEL values must be JSON-compatible and may not be null. The provider-reference `namespace` field is currently ignored.
- `ApiKey` is the default signer. It overwrites `targetHeader` (default `Authorization`) with `valueTemplate`, whose supported values are `.Token`, `.Pod`, and `.Inputs`. Its optional `when` applies only when an existing request header matches the RE2 pattern.
- `AliyunSTS` uses the STS triplet to re-sign four detected formats. It recognizes ACS3/V3 when the trimmed `Authorization` header starts with `ACS3-HMAC-SHA256 `, V1-ROA when that header starts with `acs ` and contains `:`, and OSS V4 when it starts with `OSS4-HMAC-SHA256 `. If no header scheme matches, it recognizes V1-RPC through query parameters only when the raw query parses and contains non-empty `Signature` and `AccessKeyId` values plus exactly `SignatureMethod=HMAC-SHA1`. `apiKey` is ignored for this signer; use the provider contract's `stsToken` response or the STS Secret fields. Any other Aliyun request format is undetectable and resolves through `failStrategy` before a credential is fetched.
- `failStrategy: Block` is the default and returns a generic HTTP 403. `Allow` and `Ignore` forward the request unmodified when the transformation cannot be applied. Provider calls use a 10-second HTTP timeout and are not retried by EPE.

EPE trims surrounding whitespace from credential fields and rejects embedded control bytes before creating header mutations. This prevents response errors and header injection, but it also means malformed credential material blocks or passes through according to `failStrategy`.

## Provider transport, caching, and secret boundaries

The credential provider client uses TLS 1.2 or later and normally verifies the provider certificate. It looks first for Secret-based mTLS material, then `/etc/epe/mtls/{client.crt,client.key,ca.crt}` (or the corresponding environment overrides), and finally uses system trust without a client certificate. `CREDENTIAL_PROVIDER_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true` disables server-certificate verification; it is unsafe because an on-path attacker can read the sandbox bearer token and forge credentials. Do not use it outside tightly controlled test environments.

API keys are cached by provider name plus a hash of evaluated metadata and sandbox resource ID. EPE's Helm deployment sets `TOKEN_CACHE_TTL=3h` and `TOKEN_CACHE_MAX_SIZE=10000`; invalid or non-positive direct environment values fall back to the process defaults (one hour and 100000). Provider-side rotation is visible after expiry or eviction.

STS credentials are cached only when the provider supplies an RFC 3339 `expiration`; EPE expires an entry five minutes before that timestamp. `STS_CACHE_MAX_SIZE` bounds this cache. Returned API keys and STS credentials live in EPE process memory for their cache lifetime, so keep credentials short-lived and do not place them in profile inputs, ConfigMaps, logs, policy manifests, or audit templates.

## Clean up

```console
$ kubectl delete securityprofile example-api-credentials --namespace agent-demo
```

Deleting the profile stops future transformations after the change reaches EPE. It does not revoke credentials already issued by the provider or clear credentials cached by a running EPE process; use short provider lifetimes and provider-side revocation for emergency response.
